# `.upsert()` method

The `.upsert()` method in Supastash is a local-first merge operation that inserts or updates rows based on their `id`. If a row with the given `id` exists, it is updated; if not, a new one is inserted.

This operation is ideal when you want to ensure data exists without checking beforehand ‚Äî combining the behavior of `.insert()` and `.update()`.

---

## üß† How It Works

> Each row is checked for existence using the provided `onConflictKeys` (defaults to `["id"]`). If a match is found, the row is updated. Otherwise, it is inserted.

When `.upsert()` is called:

1. The table and payload are validated.
2. Each row is inspected to check if it already exists (via `id`).
3. If it exists ‚Üí `UPDATE` it.
4. If not ‚Üí `INSERT` it.
5. Auto-adds timestamps: `updated_at`, and optionally `synced_at`.
6. Returns the upserted records from local DB.

> ‚ö° Like other write operations, `.upsert()` uses a **debounced version tracker** to batch rapid changes and trigger a **single UI refresh per table**.

## üßæ Accepted Payloads

You can pass a single object or an array of objects:

```ts
// Single row
await supastash.from("users").upsert<T>({ id: "u1", name: "John" }).run();

// Multiple rows
await supastash
  .from("users")
  .upsert<T>([
    { id: "u1", name: "John" },
    { id: "u2", name: "Doe" },
  ])
  .run();
```

If `.single()` is chained, the payload **must not** be an array.

```ts
// With custom conflict keys
await supastash
  .from("chats")
  .upsert<T>(
    { chat_id: "abc", user_id: "u1", status: "open" },
    {
      onConflictKeys: ["chat_id", "user_id"],
    }
  )
  .run();
```

## üîÅ Sync Modes

| Mode          | Behavior                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `localOnly`   | Performs upsert only on SQLite                          |
| `remoteOnly`  | Sends entire upsert payload to Supabase, skips local    |
| `localFirst`  | (Default) Performs locally, queues sync to Supabase     |
| `remoteFirst` | Sends to Supabase first, mirrors to local if successful |

You can set sync behavior using `.syncMode("...")`.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timestamp Handling

Supastash helps you keep data in sync by managing timestamps consistently:

- When using [`.update()`](./update-query.md) or `.upsert()`, **if your payload does not include an `updated_at` field**, Supastash will automatically assign `updated_at = new Date().toISOString()` before saving locally and syncing remotely.

- This ensures reliable sync conflict resolution and avoids stale data.

> Want to preserve a custom `updated_at` value (e.g., from an imported backup or pre-synced record)?
> Simply include it in your payload:

```ts
await supastash
  .from("tasks")
  .upsert({ id: "xyz", title: "Fix bug", updated_at: oldDate })
  .run();
```

If `updated_at` is explicitly set to `null` or `undefined`, it will be **replaced with the current timestamp** unless `preserveTimestamp` is configured.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For full control, use `.preserveTimestamp(true)`.

---

## ‚úÖ Return Shape

If successful:

```ts
{
  data: [...or single object],
  error: null,
  success: true
}
```

If something fails:

```ts
{
  data: null,
  error: { message: "..." },
  success: false
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ID Requirement

Every item must include an `id` field. If `id` is missing, the operation will fail.

```ts
await supastash.from("products").upsert({ name: "Invalid" }); // ‚ùå no id
```

---

## ‚úÖ When to Use `.upsert()`

- Inserting or updating without worrying about row existence
- Syncing external or merged data sources
- Avoiding manual existence checks before saving
- Supporting conflict-free offline modifications
