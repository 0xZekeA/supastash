/**
 * Supastash query builder for local-first CRUD operations.
 *
 * This builder allows you to construct and execute queries against a local SQLite store
 * with optional synchronization to Supabase.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - SELECT operations return local data by default unless `sync mode` is set to "remoteOnly".
 * - `.run()` (alias of `.execute()`) is **required** to finalize and perform the query.
 * - Use `.run({ viewRemoteResult: true })` to view the remote result from Supabase.
 * - All operations except DELETE return local data automatically â€” no need to chain `.select()`.
 *
 * @returns A chainable Supastash query instance.
 *
 * @example
 * const result = await supastash
 *   .from("users")
 *   .update({ name: "John Doe" })
 *   .eq("id", "1")
 *   .run(); // Required to execute the query
